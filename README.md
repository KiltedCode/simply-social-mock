## About the app

This is a mockup a design for a social site.

## Requirements

To run the app, you must have node and npm installed. To build the app, you'll need grunt and sass as well.

## Running the app

To run the app, simply run the command `npm start`. This will run a npm install of other dependant libraries. Depending on your system, you may need to run `sudo npm start`.

When the app is finished installing dependencies, it will start a local web server. Browse to `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`

### Building the app

If you wish to build the app, simply running `grunt` or `grunt.cmd` on Windows will concatinate and minimize the Javascript files for use by index.html. Alternatively, you can use index-dev.html, which includes the files individually.
